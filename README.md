The SpiNNaker boot ROM code was developed as part of the project 'A
scalable chip multiprocessor for large-scale neural simulation'. The
project was supported by EPSRC (the UK Engineering and Physical
Sciences Research Council) under grant EP/D07908X/1.

Many people contributed to the development of the SpiNNaker boot code,
amongst them C Patterson, S Temple, T Sharp, X Jin, MM Khan, F
Galluppi, J Garside, LA Plana and SB Furber.
