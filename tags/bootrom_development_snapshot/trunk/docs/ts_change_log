This document records the changes made by Tom Sharp to the boot ROM code starting 8th July
2010, following handover of the code from Cameron Patterson.


8th July 2010:
	
	created cameron_handover in bootrom/tag i.e. a back-up of Cameron's work to date in
	case anything goes wrong
	
	added comments to vectors.s
	
	added comments to start.s
	
	made aesthetic changes to globals.h for readability
	
	added comments to copier.s and removed any commented out lines of code
	
	moved code from dma.c/setup_crc32_spinnaker2() into peripheral_inits/init_DMA_ctrl()
	

14th July 2010:

	removed guard against receiving own frames in eth_rx_isr() (it didn't do anything)
	
	moved the 'clear interrupt' in eth_rx_isr() outside the loop (it seems like it
	shouldn't have been called repeatedly, but please confirm)
